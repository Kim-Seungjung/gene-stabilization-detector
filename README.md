# gene-stabilization-detector
Automated monitor for GENE scan runs that detects convergence from energy files using steady and oscillatory growth-rate criteria. Upon stabilization, it saves diagnostics, stops the active run, and advances to the next scan case, enabling efficient large-scale parameter scans.
